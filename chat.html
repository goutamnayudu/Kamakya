        "What is the menstrual cycle?": "The menstrual cycle is a series of hormonal changes and physiological processes that occur in the female body to prepare for pregnancy.<br><br>It typically lasts about 28 days, although it can vary from person to person.",
        "How long does a menstrual cycle typically last?": "A menstrual cycle usually lasts between 21 and 35 days, with the average being around 28 days. <br><br>However, it's normal for cycles to vary in length from month to month and for individuals to have cycles shorter or longer than the average.",
        "What are the phases of the menstrual cycle?": "The menstrual cycle consists of four main phases: menstruation (bleeding), the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. <br><br>Each phase is characterized by specific hormonal changes and physiological events in the body.",
        "What causes menstruation to occur?": "Menstruation occurs when the lining of the uterus (endometrium) sheds in response to a drop in hormone levels, particularly estrogen and progesterone. <br><br>This shedding of the uterine lining is what causes menstrual bleeding.",
        "Is it normal to experience irregular periods?": "Occasional irregularities in the menstrual cycle are common and usually not a cause for concern.<br><br> However, persistent irregularities or significant changes in menstrual patterns may indicate underlying health issues and should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.",
        "How can I track my menstrual cycle?": "There are various methods for tracking the menstrual cycle, including keeping a calendar, using smartphone apps, or using dedicated fertility tracking devices. <br><br>Tracking factors such as cycle length, symptoms, and menstrual flow can help individuals better understand their cycles and identify any irregularities.",
        "What is ovulation and how can I know when I'm ovulating?": "Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovary, typically occurring around the middle of the menstrual cycle.<br><br> Signs of ovulation include changes in cervical mucus, a slight increase in basal body temperature, and changes in cervical position. Ovulation predictor kits can also help pinpoint ovulation.",
        "What are some common menstrual disorders or conditions?": "Common menstrual disorders and conditions include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS).<br><br> These conditions can cause symptoms such as irregular periods, pelvic pain, and mood changes, and may require medical management.",
        "How can I manage menstrual discomfort or pain?": "Menstrual discomfort or pain can often be relieved with over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, applying heat to the abdomen, practicing relaxation techniques, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diet.",
        "Can I get pregnant during my period?": "While it's less likely, it is possible to get pregnant during your period, especially if your menstrual cycle is shorter. <br><br>Sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for several days, so if you have intercourse towards the end of your period and ovulate shortly afterward, conception may occur.",
		"What to do if periods got delayed?":"If you're not experiencing any concerning symptoms and it's only been a few days past your expected period, it might be best to wait and monitor the situation.Practice stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in activities you enjoy.<br><br>If your period is consistently irregular or significantly delayed, or if you experience other concerning symptoms such as severe pain, abnormal bleeding, or other unusual symptoms, it's advisable to consult a healthcare provider.",
		"What to eat to get periods?":"Consuming foods rich in iron is important for maintaining healthy blood levels, especially during menstruation when blood loss occurs.<br><br>Colorful fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support overall health and may help regulate menstrual cycles.<br><br>Drink plenty of water throughout the day, and consider incorporating hydrating foods like watermelon, cucumber, oranges, and celery into your diet.",
